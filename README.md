# WORK IN PROGRESS.
You can use the first version in the releases of Gvbvdxx Mod 2, however, i'm currently upgrading this program to use Electron.JS (works like Node.JS with GUI elements) to add more control to the program, also removing the console window complely from release builds.

# Gvbvdxx Mod 2 Extension Helper
Used to communicate through other devices and other things not possible directly through the browser.

# NOTE:
Some anti-virus programs may trigger when using Gvbvdxx Mod 2 Extension Helper, when using some extensions like Roku for a while, if this happens, simply silence the antivirus program for this program.
This program is mostly safe to use for now (not saying it's all dangerous), when using this, you may encounter some bugs or crashes in the program (due to my sort of poor programming skills).

# Requirements for usage
You must allow it to create an local WebSocket server, this is used to talk to the Gvbvdxx Mod 2 website, otherwise it will not work.
